    <h1 id="aboutme">About Me</h1>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>My name is Jack Garcia, and I’m currently studying Electrical Engineering at Pasadena City College. 
           I’m someone who loves understanding how things work — especially anything mechanical, electrical, or technical.</p>

        <p>I’m focused on building a stable future, balancing school with work, and constantly improving myself. 
           I enjoy hands-on projects, planning ahead, and finding smart ways to reach my goals.</p>

        <p>Outside of work and school, I’m into cars, performance upgrades, and learning the engineering behind engines 
           and modifications. I also have a huge passion for motorcycles — everything from the sound of a well‑tuned engine 
           to the freedom of riding. I love learning how bikes are built, how different engines deliver power, and how 
           performance mods can completely change the riding experience.</p>

        <p>Whether it’s cars or motorcycles, I enjoy staying productive, staying organized, and pushing myself to grow 
           every day through the things I’m passionate about.</p>
